    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Every single work I have done in the Computer Science pathway from 2016-2017</p>
    <h2>Light Bot</h2>

    </a>
    <p>This is the first project I have done in the Computer Science pathway in the beginning of the year,<br>
    which was late-summer 2016. Lightbot taught me the idea of programming requires several commands/procedures<br>
    in order to process and do the commands as written to it as programmed. It also taught me that programming<br>
    would take several tries and would fail over small errors.</p>
    <h2>Scratch</h2>

    </a>
    <p>Shortly after completing Lightbot, this was the next project I had to do. It was more of a intro to beginner<br>
      coders like me, and it gave me a small but yet better idea of how programming softwares might look. But yet<br>
      again it was nothing like how the rest of programmings softwares are like after finishing and moving on to the<br>
      next project. Although I would say it was better intro than Lightbot since it actually gives you the liberty to<br>
      design, code, and decide whatever you want to make.</p>
    <h2>App Inventor</h2>

    <img class="pic app" src="APP.PNG" alt="Picture of App Inventor">
    </a>
    <p>Next it was App Inventor. So before I was able to start my project for App Inventor, I had to learn the fundamentals<br>
      first in order to know some of the properties and functions available in the program. Which I had to do a few lessons/tutorials<br>
      before starting but was worth doing them since I learned many things about App Inventor and what you can do in it. Afterwards<br>
      I had to start making app with a team of other people in my class which were in the pathway as me. Of course it was difficult<br>
      since I had to deal with teamwork issues and so on. But after all, it gave me a small idea the processes of creating an app from<br>
      from scratch</p>
    <h2>Khan Academy</h2>

    <img class="pic khan" src="Khan Academy.PNG" alt="Picture of the Khan Academy website">
    </a>
    <p>For Khan Academy the idea of doing various lessons and challenges were pretty straight forward. Which I had to go through<br>
      lessons about html and css from the beginning to the end of topic. Where the lessons teach you the basics of Html and Css<br>
      and you had to go through them in order to progress to more lessons and challenges. The challenges test your understanding of<br>
      previous lesson you have passed. At the end of each lesson there were tests which were similar to the challenges but instead<br>
      it had questions that focus on the lesson you went through and you get a score of your understanding. Anyways Khan Academy has<br>
      tremendously taught me most of the things I know so far about Html and Css.</p>
    <h2>Notepad ++</h2>
    <img class="pic notepad" src="Notepad ++.PNG" alt="Picture of the free code editor Notepad++ ">
    <p>After finishing every lesson of Html and Css in Khan Academy, Notepad was next in the list of projects. I wouldn't say that<br>
       Notepad was really a project but more of a starting point of understanding how most free coding programs work and run. Also when<br>
       doing the assignment, it taught me how to open the code in a page of a browser, and how to make a link that connects the file of the<br>
       Html to a stylesheet which is the Css. Another thing in Notepad is that I learn what to expect most the free coding programs to have.</p>
